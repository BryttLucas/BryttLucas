Hello,
    I am person who likes puzzles, fixing and built things. Anything I can work on electronically is my passion. I love seeing what I am able to accomplish.
Starting in High School I was able to repairing computers and update them with new components. My first computer only had 368 MB hard drive storage on a acer system.
I have recently been helping a nonprofit organization with updating all of their media displays, Live streaming and soundboard controlls. 
     I have found time to built a new Desktop for me. Yes, It has Windows 10 and I also install a Linux operating system. They're on two different
hard drives.I am Liking the linux system so far with a lot to learn. I been told that I am easy going and friend to everbody I meet.                                  Thanks for taking some of your time to learn a little bit about me.
   
   Brytt Lucas
